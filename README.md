### TODO

- [ ] remove duplicate function in FileReader and UrlBuilder
- [ ] remove setTimeOut and make the program use waitForSelector from the library puppeteer
- [ ] show Mo instead of timestamp download progression 
- [ ] fix the bug that make FileReader infinitly \n without any reason (I suppose it's due to cli-progress unclose bar)
- [ ] add self host web version to make the program user friendly
- [ ] the hardest one : make a jellyfin extension and an api to downlaod anime from jellyfin
